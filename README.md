# Excel and AI Financial Modeling Sprint - GitLab Inc.

I am partnering with the FP&A and Investor Relations teams at GitLab Inc. to build a full three-statement financial model and valuation framework supporting their long-range planning and capital allocation discussions.

In addition, I’m also reviewing analyst sentiment, assessing GitLab’s risk disclosures, and preparing a DCF valuation and insight deck for executive-level stakeholders.Financial modeling project analyzing GitLab Inc.'s 10-K SEC filing.
